## CURRENTLY THIS FORK HAS UNFIXED BUILD ERRORS
I'm trying to fix them together with others in [this repository](https://github.com/codiflow/excalidraw-fix-httpstorage). Feel free to collaborate. üòé

---

This is a (hopefully temporary) fork from the [original excalidraw project](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) implementing:
- The recent version of Excalidraw (as of 2024-05-22)
- All the changes from [b310-digital's fork](https://github.com/b310-digital/excalidraw) (which brings support for rooms without using firebase). This fork is inspired and partly taken from [Kilian Decaderincourt](https://gitlab.com/kiliandeca/excalidraw-fork).
- The yarn-build-fix from [squatica](https://github.com/b310-digital/excalidraw/compare/master...squatica:excalidraw:fix-yarn-build)
- The redis db healthcheck from [squatica](https://github.com/kitsteam/excalidraw-storage-backend/pull/17/commits/4dbacf0079e9d7788710ff9e2eb12bd23ba94d2c)
- My own improvements regarding the docker-compose files and the redis configuration<br />

==THIS REPOSITORY SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS MID / LONG TERM SOLUTION==
I would really appreciate the upstream maintainers to implement some kind of self-hostable solution into their repository. But as long as pull requests to forks are outstanding for months and one has to fix a lot of different small issues until an up to date version of Excalidraw is up and running this repository will hopefully do it's job. üòé

## Run with docker compose

Adapt the password in `.env.default` and rename it to `.env`.

### Development

Adapt the variables according to your needs in `.env.development`

Start the containers:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up -d
```

Check the logs:
`docker compose logs -t -f`

### Production use

Adapt the variables according to your needs in `.env.production`

Start the containers:
```
docker compose -f docker-compose-prod.yml up -d
```

Check the logs:
`docker compose logs -t -f`

### Important
The collaboration mode **requires** a secure context (https). Localhost works as well, but http over a local network will throw errors in the browser console.

## Instructions taken from [b310-digital's fork](https://github.com/b310-digital/excalidraw)
==Dunno if those instructions are still up to date and working==

### Setup with docker

Please copy the .env.development.default or .env.production.default file to .env (or with environment without default at the end) and change it according to your needs, see [react-scripts](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables/).

### Development

```
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec excalidraw yarn install
docker-compose exec excalidraw yarn start
```

Hint: Collab mode requires a secure context (https). Localhost works as well, but not http over local network.
